Snakes & Ladders Power Up! Game Implementation

This module implements the Snakes & Ladders Power Up game logic as specified in the UBS challenge.
The game features two types of dice:
- Regular 1-6 die: used at the start
- Power-of-two die: activated when rolling 6 on regular die, moves by powers of 2 (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64)

Game Rules:
- Players start before square 1
- Rolling 6 on regular die: move 6 spaces + switch to power-of-two die
- Rolling 1 on power-of-two die: move 2 spaces + switch back to regular die
- Overshooting: move backwards by extra steps
- Win by reaching last square first
